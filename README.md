# Solution_Architecture_with_Ansible_Jupyter
A Jupyter Notebook provides both a big picture view and the opportunity to appreciate the details.  Components considered are a private network, the Ansible control machine and three remote hosts.  With the foundation in place, ad hoc Ansibles commands are run on the target machines to assure “as built” agrees with “as planned”.  The notebook ends with running an Ansible Playbook on the three remote hosts.
